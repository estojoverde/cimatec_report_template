The technique permits computation of numerical values of derivatives without developing analytical expressions for the derivatives. The key to the method is the decomposition of the given function, by introduction of intermediate variables, into a series of elementary functional steps. A library of elementary function subroutines is provided for the automatic evaluation and differentiation of these new variables. The final step in this process produces the desired function's derivative. The main feature of this approach is its simplicity. It can be used as a quick-reaction tool where the derivation of analytical derivatives is laborious and also as a debugging tool for programs which contain derivatives. © 1964, ACM.

Although in theory only two wavefield propagations are required, one forward propagation and one reverse propagation, it requires storing the forward propagated wavefield as a function of time to carry out the correlations which is associated with significant I/O cost. Alternatively, three wavefield propagations can be carried out to reverse propagate the forward propagated wavefield in tandem with the reverse propagated wavefield. We show how highly accurate reverse time migrated images and full waveform inversion model parameter gradients for anisotropic elastic full waveform inversion can be efficiently computed without significant disk I/O using two wavefield propagations by means of the principle of superposition.},
